# Motivation

Recently, while visiting family, the topic of online security came up.  My family are relatively tech savvy, so they'd heard about phishing, but didn't know for sure what a phishing email or a fake site actually looked like.  I prefer to learn through experience, but unfortunately, one experience of getting phished is usually one too many.  So I created an example of a fake site, with the hope of teaching people what to look out for.

# How reliable is the advice?

The world is constantly changing, web browsers are regularly improving, and phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated all the time.  But many successful attacks today still use basic techniques that we should all be aware of.  That said, the advice collected here certainly will get old, so if you think something's wrong and want to help fix it then please do send a pull request!
